\section{Chapter 4 - Adversarial training}

We need to train a model to be robust against various types of potential attacks. This will be achieved by 
minimizing the worst-case loss function. 

Let's train the model and evaluate its performance when different attacks are applied to the model. 
However, due to the computational complpexity of the exact solution method, we will test only two types of attacks:
lower bound and convex relaxation.
